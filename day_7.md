# Assembly statistics, assembly quality assessment
* genome assembly statistics
* quality of genome assembly
* gene prediction
* role of replicates in sequencing

## for assembly quality there are 3 key points
1. `conguity` - (overlapping DNA assembled to represent continous region of genome) how contigs are there?
2. `completeness` - how much of the genome is captured in assembly as compared to the genome size
3. `correctness` -  do contigs assembled represent genome
