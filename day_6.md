# NGS file formats, Quality control and preprocessing
* `NGS` seq methods - illumina pacbio
* `FASTQ` is common fromat for storing NGS ( it contain quality of the read)
* `QC` is done before the assembly process
* `flowcell` is a small glass slide or chip that contains lanes or channels where sequencing reaction takes place
  * contain oligonucleotide adapters that binds tha DNA fragments

## the details of the fastQ file 
* contains a 4 line descriptions
